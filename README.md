# NLP-Analysis-of-Political-Twitter-Users
Using Python NLP (Tweepy) to analyze tweets of Republicans and Democrats, to discover differences between them and the general population.

Steps:
Run "0 Retrieve Followers Randomly.ipynb" to retrieve random Twitter users, as a sample of the general population.
Run "0 Retrieve Followers of Person.ipynb" twice, once to find a Republican population and once to find a Democratic population.
  In my case, I used @seanhannity and @maddow to represent these groups.
Run "1 Retrieve Tweets from Followers.ipynb" three times, to retrieve tweets from the three aforementioned groups.
Run "2 Clean Tweets in Tweets Data Frame.ipynb" three times, to clean the three sets of tweets from the previous step.
Run "3 Sentiment Comparison.ipynb" to compare tweet positivity and subjectivity between Republicans and Democrats.
Run "4 Favorite Words Comparison.ipynb" to compare Republicans' and Democrats' favorite words.
